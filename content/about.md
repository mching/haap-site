# Who We Are
The Chapter is a voluntary organization of over 300 members in private, group, military and academic practice as well as pediatricians in training and other non-pediatric physicians interested in Child Health issues.

# What We Stand For

The mission of the Hawaii Chapter is to attain optimal physical, mental and social health and well-being for infants, children, adolescents and young adults. We will accomplish this mission by addressing the needs of children, their families and their communities, and by supporting Chapter members through advocacy, education, research, service and improving the systems through which they deliver pediatric care.

The Chapter will work together with the national AAP, the Hawaii Medical Association, the County Medical Societies, State and County governmental agencies, health care facilities and organizations, and other organizations and individuals interested in the health and well being of Hawaiiâ€™s children.

# What We Are Up To

The Chapter holds an annual meeting sharing news from the AAP and local topics of interest to Pediatricians. We hold two half-day conferences in the Spring and the Fall.  We offer CME.

Chapter members represent the interests of children and their doctors on numerous committee and boards, in state government (such as the Departments of Education and Health) as well as in public/private coalitions.
